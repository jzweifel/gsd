# gsd

Preconfigured and opinionated git hooks to guard your code base üê∂

## Motivation

There are many tools to choose from to help a development team choose a style and
stick to it. With gsd, you don't need to worry about choosing the style, and it
won't let you commit your code without sticking to it! üòÅ
